How to use:
-----------

Select the 2D animated layers in you want to export in your After Effects composition.

Go to File > Scripts > Run Script File...

Select the .jsx script

XML files will now be generated in the folder where the script was run from.

(!) Make sure to have unique layer names as the XML files will have the same name as the After Effects layer.
